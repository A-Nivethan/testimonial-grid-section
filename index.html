					I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if
					not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny‚Äôs worth.

				<div class="card__description">
					‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to
					make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here.
					I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled
					shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of
					my life. Since completing the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers,
					working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù

					Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting

				<div class="card__description">
					‚Äú The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really
					refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in

					community of smart and amazing people. ‚Äù

					Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!
				</div>

				<div class="card__description description--dark">
					‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I needed some
					structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I
					was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say
					wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not
					disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
					The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to
					the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often
					referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It
					certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
					multiple offers. 100% recommend! ‚Äù
